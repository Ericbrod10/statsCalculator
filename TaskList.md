## Implement Basic Calculator Functions
  * Addition Function -> Finds the sum of two numbers -> Ex: 5 + 5 = 10 -> Completed 
  * Subtraction Function -> Finds the difference of two numbers -> Ex: 7 - 5 = 2 -> Completed
  * Multiplication Function -> Multiplies two numbers together -> Ex: 7 * 5 = 35 -> Completed 
  * Division Function -> Divides two numbers and has a divide by zero error catch -> Ex: 35 / 5 = 7, Ex2: 10/0 = 'Cannot divide by 0.' -> completed
  * Square Root Function -> Finds the Square Root of a number -> Ex: SqRoot(144) = 12 -> Completed
  * Square Function -> Squares a number -> Ex: Squared(7) = 49 -> Completed
  
  
## Implement Stat Calculator Functions
  * Mean Function -> Finds the Mean of a list -> Ex: mean([5, 10, 15, 20]) = 5 + 10 + 15 + 20 = 50 / 4 = 12.5 ->Completed
  * Median -> Sorts a list and find the median -> Ex: median([5, 10, 15, 20, 25]) = 15 -> Completed
  * Mode -> Finds the number with the most occurrences in a list -> Ex: mode([5, 5, 5, 20, 25]) = 5 -> Completed
  * Variance -> Finds the Variance of a list, finds the sum of the elements subtracted by the mean and squared and divided by the number of elements -> Var([5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 5]) = 55.55 -> Completed
  * Standard Deviation -> Uses the Variance Function to find the Variance and Uses the SquareRoot Function on the Variance to find the Standard Deviation -> Completed
  * Z-Score -> Returns a z-Score Value for every element in a list, takes element and subtracts the mean of the list and divided by the standard deviation -> Completed

## Implement Random Functions
  * random function -> Generate a random number without a seed between a range of two numbers - Both Integer and Decimal -> Completed
  * random function w/ seed -> Generate a random number with a seed between a range of two numbers - Both Integer and Decimal -> Completed
  * random element from list -> Select a random element from a list -> Completed
  * random elements from list -> Select random elements from a list -> Completed - Same function as above
  * random element from list -> Set a seed and randomly select the same value from a list -> Completed
  * random elements from list w seed -> Set a seed and randomly select the same values from a list  -> Completed - Same function as above
  
  
## Implement Population Functions
  * Simple random sampling -> Uses a random function to take a sample from a list -> Completed
  * Confidence Interval For a Sample -> Finds the Confidence Interval From a set of Data -> Completed
  * Margin of Error -> Finds the Margin of Error from a set of Data
  * Cochranâ€™s Sample Size Formula -> Finds the ideal sample size given a desired level of precision desired confidence level, and the estimated proportion -> Completed
  * Find a Sample Size Given a Confidence Interval and Width -> Completed3
